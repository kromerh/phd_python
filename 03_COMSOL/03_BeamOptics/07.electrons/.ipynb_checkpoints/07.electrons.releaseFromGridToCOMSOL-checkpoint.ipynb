    "Formatting Guidelines for Files Containing Particle Data\n",
    "The imported data file should be a text file (*.txt) arranged in a spreadsheet format; that is, each row corresponds to a distinct particle and should have the same number of columns as all other rows. Columns can be separated by spaces, tabs, or a combination of the two. Begin a line with the percent (“%”) character to include comments or empty lines in the data file.\n",
    "For example, a data file containing the following text would insert particles at the positions (0.1, 0.2, 0.6) and (0.2, 0.4, 0.8) in a three-dimensional geometry:\n",

Enter the Index of first column containing position data i to indicate which column represents the first coordinate of the particle position vectors. The default value, 0, indicates the first column.\n",

    "• For From file, enter the Index of first column containing velocity data i. The default is 3. The columns are zero-indexed; that is, an index of 0 corresponds to the first column.\n",
