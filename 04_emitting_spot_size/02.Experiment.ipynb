    "Paper about neutron emitting spot size measurement (Development and characterization of a D-D fast neutron generator for imaging applications)\n",
    "- The text argues that the \"penumbra at the source\" was calculated. I would like to clarify if my understanding is correct: The penumbra is the geometrical unsharpness that results from the finite source, resulting in \"smeared edges\" on the detector screen when a sharp imaging object is imaged. In this context, what is the penumbra at the source? Is that the penumbra on the detector screen, but taking the magnification into account and computing it back \"onto the source\"? I am sorry if this description is a big \"boogey\".\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "There is no detector screen, rather a single detector which is scanned step by step with the linear motion table (Benoit is familiar with it and the controller, same controller as for the rotary table), I am not sure exactly how to describe it in an e-mail but maybe if you take a look at the MSc thesis it explains some details better, and if it's still unclear we can skype.\n",
    " \n",
    "- It seems to me very difficult to align everything properly (I think you mentioned that at some point). How did you achieve that? I imagine some laser system can be useful? Even so a sub-mm accuracy is hard\n",
    "\n",
    "Yes lasers, the source at that time was (a bit) easier to diassemble, so we took it apart and used the actual hole of the extraction as a reference point, and rigidly fixed a laser at the forward direction wall (i.e. the direction where ion beam goes) pointing at that extraction hole, then assembled the source back and practically never moved the laser, then aligned the edge perpendicular to that laser by again scanning it and looking at the light pattern on the edge, and then putting the detector there and doing the same. Hard to describe, lots of playing around until it seemed good. In our case the hope is that with a thin edge the perpendicularity of the edge is less critical, and also if the detector is more shallow it is also less critical that it is aligned perfectly, so with both of those true one can use maybe less complicated and precise alignment methods to get a reasonable result. What is important to keep in mind is that any \"error\" with alignment just means a blurred spot, so it is in all cases conservative (i.e. if you conclude from the FWHM that it's 2 mm, it is more like >=2 mm, i.e. \"conservative\" since we want it to be small)\n",
    " \n",
    ".\n",
    "\n",
    "- How does one compute the energy deposited in the detector volume with MCNP? Is that done in a separate step by computing the flux with MCNP and then some analytical way (Reaction rate & cross-section of elastic collision)\n",
    "\n",
    "iirc the final approach was ptrac, or at least at some points ptrac was tried (which stands for \"painful trac\" I guess), maybe a simplification was used in the end, I'm not certain, anything can be used as long as the approximations are reasonable\n",

    "\n",
    "Considering practical materials tungsten is probably the most attenuating which is feasible to use, as far as I know, mainly due to its high density. I am not sure where it is then, but anyway you probably would want a bit thicker one, like few mm instead of ~1 mm, but some calculations should later justify that a bit (at least rough calculations)\n",
    " \n",
    "- What do you mean with 1-2 edges are precise? Do you mean 1-2 sides of the tungsten piece should be precisely perpendicularly machined, or do you propose \"steps\" in the piece (why)\n",
    "\n",
    "As you wrote, they are precise as in machined perpendicular to the face, not just some rough cut\n",
    " \n",
    "- You mention a smaller detector, is there something available? I am not up to date on your latest detector adventures, but afaik you built predominantly gamma/x-ray ones for Michigan?\n",
    "\n",
    "We have the standard old ones, or with relatively low to medium effort you could have 2x6x15 mm2 (scintillators are on hand), maybe also 2x2x12 or something like that is sitting around somehwere, with slightly more effort almost any size could be cut, we have the raw plastic and another group can cut/polish a piece for us to any reasonable size\n",
    " \n",
    "Would it make sense that for now we consider the \"old\" detectors, so similar to the ones you used? I could for now set up the MCNP simulation (source distribution, distances, thickness of tungsten etc) and check for a suitable tungsten piece. Could you give me an idea of the size and I check if I find it in your stuff? Maybe it fell victim to Benoits cleaning habits.\n",
    "On the alignment of the setup I could ask a technician for some input.\n",
    "\n",
    "I would consider the scintillator size as completely free, in case a different size is significantly better performance then we can use any size. You can ask a technician if you want but I guess our situation is too peculiar, and just improvising something with lasers or large T-squares is more or less the best you can do. I mean this kind of stuff with T-square\n",
    "\n",
    "## another email\n",
    "\n",
    "Maybe I'm confusing you, or the situation. I just meant that the effective count rate vs. detector depth can be approximated as in Figure 8 of paper 1 attached. (relative to the incoming flux on the front surface of the detector). In other words, yes this does not have to come from MCNP, as long as you know what's hitting the surface (which comes from MCNP I guess).\n",
    "\n",
    "Somewhat separately is the issue of penumbra. The depth of the detector changes the \"measured\" ESF curve, so it must be simulated, also explicitly for multiple cases? Or can this effect be excluded because the beam is parallel enough? I can't remember.\n",
    "\n",
    "Assuming that the detector-depth-penumbra effect is not negligible (maybe it is)....\n",
    "\n",
    "Maybe a more clever way would be to simulate, for a given detector area, the detector as multiple cells, each representing a single depth, and then you basically have multiple depths all at once with one simulation? If the material is correctly defined, the self-shielding would be well approximated if you took e.g. every 1 mm thickness as its own cell. Could have e.g. 20 of such cells. In the MCNP output it gives \"collisions\" for each cell I think. The events detected in each is simply from sigma_H / (sigma_H + sigma_C) in the detector material, multiplied by the number of collisions, and then this multiplied by 0.7 to account for pulse height threshold (it's a rough number, doesn't really matter though, just a constant). This would have to be scaled according to the solid angle depending on how you define the source or whatever, to get it to an actual counts/s at a given source output. In post processing you could take just the first cell in terms of depth, then 1+2, then 1+2+3, etc. to basically have results for all of the depths.\n",
    "\n",
    "Otherwise if this is not needed then yes, just the flux through the face of the detector (facing the source) would be needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Somewhat of a separate issue, though, is that this assumes perfect alignment, so with more detector depth you have larger sensitivity to misalignment, but maybe that can be taken into account with some simple pencil and paper geometry.\n",
    "\n",
    "Anything I'm writing make sense? Sorry again if it's premature, still did not dig into the details of what you already did, maybe I'm going in the wrong direction with my comments.\n",
